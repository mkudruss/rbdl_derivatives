 * compute the accelerations. In this case the first 6 entries of Q, QDot,
 * Tau, and QDDot are first the translations and then the rotations of the
 * floating base. The 6 DoF are ordered in the following way:
 *   0: x translation
 *   1: y translation
 *   2: z translation
 *   3: z rotation
 *   4: y rotation
 *   5: x rotation
