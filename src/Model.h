 * This class contains all information required to perform the forward
 * dynamics calculation. The variables in this class are also used for
 * storage of temporary values. It is designed for use of the Articulated
 * Rigid Body Algorithm (which is implemented in ForwardDynamics()) and
 * follows the numbering as described in Featherstones book.
 *
 * An important note is that body 0 is the root body and the moving bodies
 * start at index 1. Additionally the vectors for the states q, qdot, etc.
 * have \#Model::dof_count + 1 entries where always the first entry (e.g. q[0])
 * contains the value for the base (or "root" body. Thus the numbering might be
 * confusing as q[1] holds the position variable of the first degree of
 * freedom. This numbering scheme is very beneficial in terms of readability
 * of the code as the resulting code is very similar to the pseudo-code in
 * the RBDA book.
