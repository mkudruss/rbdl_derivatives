RBDL - Rigid Body Dynamics Library

This code is mainly an C++ implementation of Roy Featherstone's Articulated
Body Algorithm (ABA) written by Martin Felis. The code tightly follows the
notation used in Featherstone's book "Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithm".

The documentation is contained in the code and can be extracted with the
tool doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org).

To create the documentation simply run
  doxygen Doxyfile
which will generate the documentation in the subdirectory ./doc/html. The
mainpage will then be located in ./doc/html/index.html.
