RBDL - Rigid Body Dynamics Library

This library contains some essential rigid body dynamics library such as
the Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA) for forward dynamics, Newton-Euler
Algorithm for inverse dynamics and the Composite Rigid Body Algorithm
(CRBA) for the efficient computation of the joint space inertia matrix.

This code evolved mainly from a C++ implementation of Roy Featherstone's
Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA) written by Martin Felis. The code tightly
follows the notation used in Featherstone's book "Rigid Body Dynamics
Algorithm".

DOCUMENTATION

The documentation is contained in the code and can be extracted with the
tool doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org).

To create the documentation simply run
  doxygen Doxyfile
which will generate the documentation in the subdirectory ./doc/html. The
mainpage will then be located in ./doc/html/index.html.

LICENSING

The library is published under the very permissive zlib free software
license which should allow you to use the software wherever you need. For
details see LICENSE file.

Please note that this library also comes with the Eigen3 library which is
licensed under the GPL version 2 or later. See http://eigen.tuxfamily.org
