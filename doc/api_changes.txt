1.X.Y -> 2.0.0
- removed Model::Init():
  All initialization is now done in the default constructor in Model(). To
	be compatible with the new API simply remove any calls to Model::Init().

1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
- removed constructor Body (mass, com, length, gyration_radii)
  This constructor did some erroneous calculations to compute the real
	radii of gyration. It was removed as the two remaining constructors are
	properly tested and are more general.
