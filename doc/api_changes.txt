1.X.Y -> 2.0.0
- removed Model::Init():
  All initialization is now done in the default constructor in Model(). To
	be compatible with the new API simply remove any calls to Model::Init().
- ConstraintSet::constraint_force and ConstraintSet::constraint_impulse are
	now the forces or impulses that are acting on the constrained body by the
	constraint.
