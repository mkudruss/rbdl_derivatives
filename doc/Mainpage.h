 *
 * This is the documentation of RBDL, the Rigid Body Dynamics Library. The
 * library contains highly efficient code for both forward and inverse
 * dynamics. It includes:
 *
 * \li Recursive Newton Euler Algorithm
 * \li Composite Rigid Body Algorithm
 * \li Articulated Body Algorithm.
 *
 * Furthermore it contains functions for forward and inverse kinematics and
 * contact handling.
 *
 * The code is written by <a
 * href="mailto:martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de">Martin Felis
 * <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de></a> and heavily inspired by the
 * pseudo code of the book "Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms" of <a
 * href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~roy/">Roy Featherstone</a>.
 * 
 * The library comes with version 3 of the the
 * <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/">Eigen</a> math library. More
 * information about it can be found here:
 * <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/">http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/</a>.
 *
 * \section ModelConstruction Construction of Models
 *
 * The construction of \link RigidBodyDynamics::Model Models \endlink makes
 * use of carefully designed constructors of the classes \link
 * RigidBodyDynamics::Body Body \endlink and \link RigidBodyDynamics::Joint
 * Joint \endlink to ease the process of creating bodies.  Adding bodies to
 * the model is done by specifying the parent body by its id, the
 * transformation from the parent origin to the joint origin, the joint
 * specification as an object, and the body itself. These parameters are
 * then fed to the function RigidBodyDynamics::Model::AddBody().
 *
 * A simple example can be found \ref SimpleExample "here".
 * 
 * \section ModuleOverview API reference separated by functional modules

 * \li \ref kinematics_group
 * \li \ref dynamics_group
 * \li \ref contacts_group
 *
 * \section Licensing Licensing
 *
 * The library is published under the very permissive zlib free software
 * license which should allow you to use the software wherever you need.
 * Here is the full license text:
